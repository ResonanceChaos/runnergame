-------Clothing loss and state in action example--------------
Graboid Monster begins swallowing Grapple
Player escapes, Covered in white slime
Landing on the ground she recovers and attempts to rush in to attack
Slips falling prone infront of mob, Low stamina from escaping doesnt let her immediately stand (should have rolling dodge back)
Stamina now probably isnt high enough to escape new grapple.
/////////////////////////////
Green slime Floor
Player steps on it at slow speed and is Stuck to floor
Balance meter to escape
Fails and loses a shoe in slime (Unrecoverable)
Fails worse and falls
Loses hoodie (Unrecoverable)
Suseptable to enemy attacks while Stuck
needs to have enemies nearby incase she loses all loseable clothing and there isnt anything there to knock her out of it or kill her.
/////////////////////////////
Fall in deep mud
High stamia drain to escape, otherwise acts as quicksand
////////////////////////////

Careful level design should be taken to ensure the player isnt "stuck and cant proceed or cant suicide to restart" Meaning there should be Traps 
or enemies near things like this so you're not stuck in the bottom of a box you cant get out of.
